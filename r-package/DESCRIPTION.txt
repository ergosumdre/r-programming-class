The purpose of this package is to create a data frame that is ready to be
exported into Network Analysis Mapping Software, Gephi. This package will 
leverage Twitter API Data to build a list of edges and nodes, then 
arrange the data frame into a capable directed Gephi format. A Node will 
be classified as a Twitter User, and an Edge will be the act of Retweet.
